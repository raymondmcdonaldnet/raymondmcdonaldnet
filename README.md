## Raymond McDonald, Netizen and Data-Driven Developer

Hello! I'm passionate about programming languages, functional programming, data-driven design, data-oriented programming, and the Internet, all tied together by a life-long interest in writing.

I work a lot in Go and TypeScript, but I also have experience with C/C++, C#, and Lua. I'm currently polishing up my portfolio before I begin seeking my first software engineering job. Care to give me a shot?
