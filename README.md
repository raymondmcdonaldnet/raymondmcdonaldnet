## Raymond McDonald, the .NET game dev guy

I'm passionate about game development, computing, computer science, functional programming, data-oriented programming, C++, and .NET, all complemented by a lifelong interest in writing.

Currently, I am working on my first large game. I'm getting into teaching programming using C++ and game development. Interested in collaborating or taking lessons? E-mail me!
