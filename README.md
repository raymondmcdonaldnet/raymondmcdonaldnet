## Raymond McDonald, DDD: Data-Driven Developer

I'm passionate about computing, computer science, functional programming, game development, ECS, data-driven design, and data-oriented programming, all complemented by a lifelong interest in writing.

My favorite programming languages are C#, C++, Lua, and Odin. I've dabbled in many others, too.

Currently, I am working on my first large game using C++ with Raylib and Flecs. I'm getting into teaching programming using C++ and game development. Interested in collaborating or taking lessons? E-mail me!
