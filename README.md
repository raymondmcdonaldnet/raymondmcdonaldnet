## Raymond McDonald, Netizen and Data-Driven Developer

Hello! I'm passionate about game development, computer graphics, data-driven design, and data-oriented programming, all tied together by a life-long interest in writing.

My favorite programming languages are Odin, C#, Lua, GDScript, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I've dabbled in many others, too.

I'm currently working to start regularly releasing small indie games made in RPG Maker. I'm learning how to make JavaScript plugins for RPG Maker, too. If you're interested in collaborating, please get in touch!
