## Raymond McDonald, the .NET game dev guy

I'm passionate about game development, functional programming, data-oriented programming, and .NET, all complemented by a lifelong interest in writing.

Currently, I am working on my first large game using MonoGame. I'm interested in getting into teaching programming using .NET and game development.
