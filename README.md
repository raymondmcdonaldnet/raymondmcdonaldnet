## Raymond McDonald, Netizen and Data-Driven Developer

Hello! I'm passionate about game development, programming languages, computer graphics, functional programming, data-driven design, data-oriented programming, and the Internet, all tied together by a life-long interest in writing.

I'm currently working to start regularly releasing indie games for the web. If you're interested in collaborating, please get in touch!
